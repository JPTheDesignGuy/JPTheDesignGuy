 <p>This project was designed utilizing Photoshop and was created to target the Louisville audience. You can see in the design that I used elements that are common in the Louisville area including horses, the Louisville cardinal and the Louisville city scape. This project also utilizes jQuery movement to make the site more interactive.</p>
